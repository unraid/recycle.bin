**Recycle Bin**

This plugin adds a per share '.Recycle.Bin' folder to hold samba deleted files until you empty the trash either manually or remove aged files on a schedule.  A '.Recycle.Bin' folder is created in each share the first time a file is deleted in the share that you can access by browsing to //Tower/Share/.Recycle.Bin.  You can restore deleted files from the //Tower/Share/.Recycle.Bin.  The User access to the '.Recycle.Bin' folder is the same as the User share access.  If you remove the plugin all deleted files will be kept in the share '.Recycle.Bin' folders.  You will have to empty the trash before you remove the plugin if you do not want to use it.
